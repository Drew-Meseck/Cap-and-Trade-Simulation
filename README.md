# To Run this Model:
1) Clone or download this repository

2) Install the requirements from the requirements.txt folder either onto your machine or in a virtual environment contained within the main project directory.

3) Navigate to the main directory, (ensuring your virtual environment is active if you used one)

4) type "mesa runserver" into the command line in the project folder, this will call the run.py script which launches the specified server GUI from the server.py folder. A new browser window should open on a locally hosted port.

5) Drag input sliders to desired values, and select the auction status, and select "Start" this should run the model!
