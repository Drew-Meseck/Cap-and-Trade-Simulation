# Cap-and-Trade-Simulation
Economics Capstone

TO COMPLETE:

SETUP:
Create agents and produce unconstrained for period -1
    -- DONE 10/25/20
Determine the number of allowances based on current environmental emissions
    -- DONE 10/25/20


ALLOCATION:
Add strategy based bid decisions to company agents for the auction.

Add output based allocation based on the number of allowances, companies, and capacity of those companies.

MARKET:
Implement the trading step using market strategies (Most will probably try to buy to produce the max, size will factor in if they are big technology investors though).

Really refine this system and read about how this should play out based on existing literature to justify.

DATA COLLECTION:
Implement data collection for each period (use aggregation as well as maybe group by company type for strategy analysis).

DEBUG:
Find ranges of input values that create sustainable systems for experimental design

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
Find a few different experiments, regarding lobbying and investment values, to run full experiments on
